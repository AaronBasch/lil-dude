# unicycle_robot

A minimalist arena survival game. Eliminate shape-coded target families before they overwhelm you.

## Quick Start

```
git clone https://github.com/AaronBasch/lil-dude.git
cd lil-dude
open index.html
```

## Controls

**Movement**
- `←` `→` `↑` `↓` — Move in any direction

**Attacks (WASD)**
- `W` — Jab up
- `A` — Jab left
- `S` — Jab down
- `D` — Jab right
- Hold any direction to extend the blade

**Speed**
- Hold `Space` — Fast mode

## Gameplay

- Targets spawn in families (1-4 members) that share the same shape and color
- Hit all family members within the vulnerability window to eliminate them
- If you don't eliminate the whole family in time, hit members recover
- Colliding with active targets costs a life (you have 3)
- Each level spawns more families
- Clear all targets to advance to the next level

## Tips

- When you hit a target, its family starts blinking — hit the rest quickly
- Transparent (hit) family members won't damage you
- Larger families are harder but more rewarding
- Use fast mode to close distance, slow mode to line up attacks
